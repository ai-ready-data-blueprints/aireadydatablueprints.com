# Architectural Decisions: AI Ready Data Blueprints Website

## Architecture Choice: MONOLITH

**Decision Date**: 2025-01-28T22:44:45Z

## Rationale

### Why MONOLITH is Perfect for This Project

**Project Characteristics**:
- Static HTML5 website with 6 pages
- Simple content presentation (no complex business logic)
- GitHub Pages hosting (static site deployment)
- GitHub Actions build (simple CI/CD)
- Single deployment unit requirement

**Key Factors Supporting Monolith Decision**:

1. **Simplicity**: Static website with straightforward content delivery
2. **Deployment Model**: GitHub Pages requires single deployment unit
3. **Team Structure**: Likely small team managing website content
4. **Operational Complexity**: Minimal - static site hosting
5. **Performance**: Single bundle optimal for static content
6. **Development Speed**: Faster initial development and deployment

### Architecture Benefits for This Project

**Operational Simplicity**:
- Single GitHub repository
- One build pipeline
- Simple deployment to GitHub Pages
- Easy debugging and testing
- Minimal operational overhead

**Development Efficiency**:
- All code in one repository
- Shared components and styles
- Consistent navigation and theming
- Single build process
- Easy local development

**Performance Optimization**:
- Single CSS/JS bundle
- Optimized asset loading
- Better caching strategies
- Reduced network requests
- Faster page loads

### Trade-offs Acknowledged

**Accepted Limitations**:
- All pages deployed together (acceptable for static content)
- Single technology stack (HTML/CSS/JS - already required)
- Shared codebase (beneficial for consistency)

**Not Applicable Concerns**:
- Scaling limitations (static site, minimal server load)
- Technology lock-in (simple web technologies)
- Team coordination (small team, simple project)

## Implementation Approach

**Structure**:
- Single HTML5 application
- Shared CSS for consistent styling
- Shared JavaScript for common functionality
- Component-based organization within monolith
- Modular CSS and JS files for maintainability

**Deployment**:
- GitHub Actions build pipeline
- Single deployment to GitHub Pages
- Automated build on main branch commits
- Static asset optimization

**Development**:
- Component-based development within single codebase
- Shared navigation and theme components
- Consistent styling and behavior across pages
- Easy cross-page feature implementation
