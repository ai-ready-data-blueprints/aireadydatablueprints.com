# Design Generation Plan: AI Ready Data Blueprints Website (Monolith)

## Overview
This plan outlines the design methodology for creating a monolithic static HTML5 website with modern architecture patterns.

## Design Development Methodology

### Phase 1: Architecture Pattern Selection
- [x] Choose primary architectural pattern for code organization
- [x] Define component structure and dependencies
- [x] Establish separation of concerns approach

### Phase 2: Technology Stack Definition
- [x] Select core technologies and frameworks
- [x] Define build and deployment tools
- [x] Establish development environment setup

### Phase 3: Component Organization Strategy
- [x] Design modular component structure
- [x] Define component interfaces and dependencies
- [x] Establish reusable component patterns

### Phase 4: Design System Planning
- [x] Define styling approach and methodology
- [x] Plan responsive design strategy
- [x] Establish theme system architecture

## Design Planning Questions

### Q1: Architecture Pattern
Which architectural pattern should guide the code organization?
A) Layered Architecture (traditional separation: presentation, business, data)
B) Component-Based Architecture (modular components with clear interfaces)
C) Feature-Based Architecture (organize by website features/pages)
D) Hybrid approach combining patterns
[Answer]: C

### Q2: Technology Stack
What core technologies should be used?
A) Pure HTML5/CSS3/Vanilla JavaScript
B) HTML5/CSS3 with minimal JavaScript framework (e.g., Alpine.js)
C) Static site generator (Jekyll, Hugo, etc.)
D) Modern build tools with bundling (Webpack, Vite, etc.)
[Answer]: A

### Q3: CSS Architecture
How should styles be organized and managed?
A) Traditional CSS with BEM methodology
B) CSS Modules for component isolation
C) Utility-first CSS (Tailwind-like approach)
D) CSS-in-JS or styled components approach
[Answer]: A

### Q4: Component Organization
How should components be structured?
A) Page-based organization (styles/scripts per page)
B) Component-based organization (reusable UI components)
C) Feature-based organization (group by functionality)
D) Atomic design methodology (atoms, molecules, organisms)
[Answer]: A

### Q5: Responsive Design Strategy
What approach should be used for mobile responsiveness?
A) Mobile-first responsive design
B) Desktop-first with mobile adaptations
C) Adaptive design with breakpoint-specific layouts
D) Fluid/flexible design with relative units
[Answer]: A

### Q6: Theme System Architecture
How should dark/light mode be implemented?
A) CSS custom properties (CSS variables) with class toggle
B) Separate CSS files for each theme
C) JavaScript-based theme switching with localStorage
D) CSS-only solution with prefers-color-scheme
[Answer]: A

### Q7: Build and Deployment Strategy
What build process should be used?
A) No build process - direct HTML/CSS/JS files
B) Simple build with asset optimization and minification
C) Modern build pipeline with bundling and tree-shaking
D) Static site generator with automated builds
[Answer]: A

### Q8: Performance Optimization Approach
How should performance be optimized?
A) Manual optimization (image compression, minification)
B) Automated build-time optimization
C) Runtime optimization with lazy loading
D) Comprehensive optimization strategy (all approaches)
[Answer]: A

## Architecture Pattern Options

### Layered Architecture
**Benefits**: 
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to understand and maintain
- Traditional and well-established

**Trade-offs**:
- Can become rigid for simple sites
- May introduce unnecessary complexity

### Component-Based Architecture
**Benefits**:
- Reusable and modular components
- Easy to test and maintain
- Scalable for future features

**Trade-offs**:
- Requires more initial setup
- May be overkill for simple sites

### Feature-Based Architecture
**Benefits**:
- Organized by business functionality
- Easy to locate and modify features
- Aligns with user stories

**Trade-offs**:
- May create code duplication
- Less reusability across features

### Hybrid Approach
**Benefits**:
- Combines best of multiple patterns
- Flexible and adaptable
- Can evolve with project needs

**Trade-offs**:
- Requires clear decision criteria
- May be complex to maintain consistency
