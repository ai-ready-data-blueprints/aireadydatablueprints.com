# Code Generation Plan: AI Ready Data Blueprints Website (Monolith)

## Overview
This plan outlines the code generation strategy for the static HTML5 website based on the component dependency matrix and approved design.

## Code Generation Phases (Based on Dependency Matrix)

### Phase 7.1: Foundation Components (No Dependencies)
- [x] Theme Manager (CSS custom properties system)
- [x] Page Router (simple client-side navigation)
- [x] Book Info Component (static data display)
- [x] Download Handler (PDF download utility)
- [x] External Link Handler (external link management)

### Phase 7.2: Utility Components (Depends on Foundation)
- [x] Theme Toggle (depends on Theme Manager)
- [x] Navigation Component (depends on Theme Manager, Page Router)

### Phase 7.3: Layout Components (Depends on Foundation + Utility)
- [x] Mobile Menu (depends on Navigation Component)
- [x] Header Component (depends on Navigation, Theme Toggle)
- [x] Footer Component (depends on Book Info)
- [x] Author Card Component (depends on External Link Handler)

### Phase 7.4: Page Components (Depends on All Lower Layers)
- [x] Home Page (depends on Book Info, Author Card)
- [x] How to Buy Page (depends on Book Info, External Link Handler)
- [x] Code Samples Page (depends on External Link Handler)
- [x] Download Blueprints Page (depends on Download Handler)
- [x] Contact Authors Page (depends on Author Card, External Link Handler)
- [x] Request Engagement Page (depends on Author Card)

## Code Generation Questions

### Q1: File Organization Strategy
How should the code files be organized?
A) Single files per page (index.html, styles.css, script.js per page)
B) Modular files with shared components (shared CSS/JS + page-specific files)
C) Component-based files (separate CSS/JS file per component)
D) Hybrid approach (shared base + component modules + page-specific)
[Answer]: B 

### Q2: CSS Implementation Approach
How should the BEM methodology and CSS variables be implemented?
A) Single main.css file with all styles and BEM classes
B) Modular CSS files (main.css + component CSS files)
C) CSS files per page with shared variables file
D) Component-based CSS with import system
[Answer]: A

### Q3: JavaScript Architecture
How should the vanilla JavaScript be structured?
A) Single main.js file with all functionality
B) Modular JS files (main.js + component JS files)
C) Page-specific JS files with shared utilities
D) Component-based JS modules with import system
[Answer]: A

### Q4: Theme System Implementation
How should the dark/light mode system be coded?
A) CSS-only with prefers-color-scheme and data attributes
B) JavaScript toggle with localStorage and CSS custom properties
C) Separate CSS files for each theme with JS switching
D) Hybrid CSS/JS approach with automatic and manual switching
[Answer]: D

### Q5: Navigation Implementation
How should the page navigation and routing be handled?
A) Traditional multi-page site (separate HTML files, server routing)
B) Single Page Application (SPA) with JavaScript routing
C) Hybrid approach (separate HTML files + enhanced navigation)
D) Progressive enhancement (works without JS, enhanced with JS)
[Answer]: A

### Q6: Responsive Design Implementation
How should the mobile-first responsive design be coded?
A) CSS Grid and Flexbox with media queries
B) CSS Framework approach (Bootstrap-like utilities)
C) Custom responsive utilities with CSS custom properties
D) Component-based responsive design with breakpoint mixins
[Answer]: A

### Q7: Asset Management
How should images, fonts, and other assets be handled?
A) Direct file references with manual optimization
B) Organized asset folders with naming conventions
C) Asset optimization with build-time processing
D) CDN integration for external assets
[Answer]: B

### Q8: Code Quality and Standards
What coding standards and quality measures should be implemented?
A) Basic formatting and naming conventions only
B) ESLint/Prettier for JavaScript, basic CSS standards
C) Comprehensive linting, formatting, and documentation standards
D) Minimal standards focusing on functionality over style
[Answer]: A

### Q9: GitHub Actions Deployment
How should the GitHub Actions deployment be configured?
A) Simple deployment (copy files to gh-pages branch)
B) Basic optimization (minify CSS/JS, optimize images)
C) Comprehensive build pipeline (linting, testing, optimization)
D) Minimal deployment (direct file push to GitHub Pages)
[Answer]: A

### Q10: Development Workflow
What development workflow should be established?
A) Direct editing and commit to main branch
B) Feature branches with pull request reviews
C) Development branch with staging and production environments
D) Simple workflow with minimal process overhead
[Answer]: A

## Implementation Strategy Options

### Single File Approach
**Benefits**: 
- Simple to understand and maintain
- No build complexity
- Fast initial development

**Trade-offs**:
- Larger file sizes
- Harder to maintain as project grows
- Less modular organization

### Modular File Approach
**Benefits**:
- Better organization and maintainability
- Reusable components
- Easier to debug and update

**Trade-offs**:
- More complex file structure
- Requires careful dependency management
- May need build process for optimization

### Component-Based Approach
**Benefits**:
- Highly modular and reusable
- Clear separation of concerns
- Scalable architecture

**Trade-offs**:
- More complex setup
- May be overkill for static site
- Requires module system or build tools

### Hybrid Approach
**Benefits**:
- Balances simplicity and modularity
- Flexible and adaptable
- Can evolve with project needs

**Trade-offs**:
- Requires clear guidelines
- May be inconsistent without discipline
- More complex than single file approach
